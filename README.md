## Resume Screening App using NLP and Machine Learning
I developed a resume screening app that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable job category based on the content of resumes. This project demonstrates my ability to handle the full machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment in a user-friendly web application.

### Project Highlights:

#### Dataset:
Analyzed and processed a dataset of resumes, applying NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization.

#### Model Training:
Implemented a multi-label classification approach using KNeighborsClassifier and OneVsRestClassifier to predict job categories from resumes. The model was trained on a split dataset (training and test sets) to ensure robust predictions.

#### Web App:
Built a simple, interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload a resume (in PDF or text format) and receive real-time predictions about the suitable job category.

### Tools & Technologies:

Python for development

NLP techniques for text cleaning and preprocessing

Scikit-learn for machine learning model development

TF-IDF for feature extraction

Streamlit for building the web application

Pickle for model serialization and deployment

### Key Features:

User Interaction: Users can upload resumes directly via the web app.

Real-time Prediction: The app provides a predicted job category, making it easier for employers to assess potential roles for candidates.

Clean and Interactive Interface: Streamlit was used to create a clean, minimal interface with drag-and-drop functionality for ease of use.
